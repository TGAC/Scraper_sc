This project automates the extraction of structured metadata from scientific papers in PDF format. Using the OpenAI GPT model, it populates a standardised Excel workbook with metadata for single-cell RNA-seq studies. Each PDF is parsed and its contents used to fill out the appropriate fields across multiple Excel sheets, one per metadata category.
