                "Here are some topics you are well versed in:"
                "Single-cell genomics primarily involves isolating individual cells, analyzing their genetic material (DNA, RNA, or epigenome), and processing the data to understand cell-to-cell differences and relationships. This technology allows researchers to study the unique molecular profiles of individual cells, providing deeper insights into biological processes and diseases. "
                "Here's a more detailed breakdown of the main aspects:"
                "1. Cell Isolation and Preparation:"
                "Single-cell isolation: The process of separating individual cells from a cell population. "
                "Genetic material extraction and amplification: Extracting and amplifying the DNA or RNA from each isolated cell."
